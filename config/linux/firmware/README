   dvb-ttpci-01.fw-2622 Firmware 01.2622

The files are named dvb-ttpci-VV.fw-vvvv

  VV : Version of firmware-to-host API. You can simply upgrade
       the firmware binary with a newer one of the same API
       version without changing anything else in the driver.
  vvvv: Firmware version. Increased with each functional change.

It is recommended that you use the newest firmware binary
compatible with your driver. If you use the hotplug firmware loader
in Linux 2.6 you must put the firmware file in
/lib/firmware/dvb-ttpci-01.fw (in previous versions of the Linux
hotplug scripts it was /usr/lib/hotplug/firmware/dvb-ttpci-01.fw).

Boot.S is the source for the boot loader which is included
as a binary blob in the bootcode array in av7110_hw.c in
the Linux driver source. For more information check the
driver tarball at http://www.metzlerbros.org/dvb/.

2005-11-23 dvb-ttpci-01.fw-2622
        Changes by Werner Fink:
         - AC3 output for live channels
         - audio and PES filter error handling fixes
         - tons of changes for better/faster A/V sync and PCR handling
         - Initial implementation for ES/RAW audio support
        Changes by Oliver Endriss:
          - support for extended RC5 (aka RC5+) infrared protocol
          - fixed DPRAM timing to get rid of strange pseudo-handshake

2005-07-06 dvb-ttpci-01.fw-261f
        Changes by Werner Fink:
          Restart error IRQ handler in case of an overflow as
          described in the API manual.
          Better auto detection of PES formats with AC3 and DTS frames not
          starting with the payload of PES frames with PTS value.

          Allow non aligned PES frames which include a substream ID for
          PCM/AC3/DTS.

          Use silent PCM for delay the PCM/AC3/DTS data to be able to
          compensate the PTS offset of Audio and Video PES frames.  Mainly
          done to be able to synchronize even within VDR transfer mode
          where AV data are received just in time from the TV channel.

          Calculate  the byte rate of Mpeg Audio date to be able to
          synchronize without an hard offset.  This avoid jumps within
          picture sequence due high PTS offsets at synching time. Also use
          the sync API for Mpeg Audio at startup.

          Add PTS reset after a PCM Bypass to be able to recover fast
          enough and shorten the time used in the blank timer for
          recovering.

          Be sure that the Bits in the message status register are done
          well.  Add two new bits which indicates play mode and stop spare
          time.

          Make ReleaseBmp work even during running Bitmap upload.  Be sure
          that normal OSD command sequences will not destroxed by a normal
          ReleaseBmp.  Be sure that the ACK to the PC work even if the
          Bitmap upload is premature aborted.

          Add a workaround to be sure that TX_BUFF is really reset by the
          PC and does not provide the old value.  It seems that modifying
          of IRQ_RX by the PC is not always in sync.

2005-xx-xx dvb-ttpci-01.fw-261e
           (not officially released)

2004-12-26 dvb-ttpci-01.fw-261d
